/**
 * Shared handling for a paid call that stopped on the output cap.
 *
 * The facts extractor proved the shape: when Bedrock reports
 * `stopReason: "max_tokens"`, the response is cut mid-structure, the parser
 * discards it, and the caller reports "nothing found" for content that was
 * never emitted. Retrying at the SAME cap cannot help — these calls run at
 * temperature 0, so the identical prompt truncates in the identical place.
 * The retry has to buy more room, and only when the caller's budget says the
 * second call fits.
 *
 * This module is the one implementation of that; call sites supply a `call`
 * closure taking the cap, and a `canAffordRetry` predicate. Without the
 * predicate there is no retry: an unbudgeted second call against a paid model
 * is never the safe default.
