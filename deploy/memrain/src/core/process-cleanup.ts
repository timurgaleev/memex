/**
 * Process-cleanup registry.
 *
 * A registry + signal handlers so abnormal termination (SIGTERM/SIGHUP/SIGPIPE,
 * EPIPE on stdout, uncaughtException) releases held resources instead of leaking
 * them. The motivating case: a held DB lock (`db-lock.ts`) would otherwise sit
 * orphaned for up to its TTL (30 min) after a `docker compose up -d --build`
 * SIGTERMs the container mid-cycle — the next cycle then can't acquire.
 *
 * Design:
 *  - Signal scope: SIGHUP, SIGPIPE, uncaughtException, unhandledRejection, and
 *    an EPIPE-on-stdout/stderr handler. NOT SIGINT/SIGTERM — memex's `serve`
 *    daemon already installs a graceful SIGINT/SIGTERM `shutdown()` that
 *    releases the held cycle lock (via `cycle.stop()`) before closing the
 *    engine. Registering a competing SIGTERM handler here would race that
 *    shutdown — a fast cleanup pass `process.exit()`s before the graceful drain
 *    (worker/server/storage close) finishes. So this module covers only the
 *    ABNORMAL signals where the graceful path does NOT run; the app owns the
 *    clean-cancel signals.
 *  - Idempotent: a second signal during the cleanup pass is a NO-OP. The first
 *    pass runs to its 3s deadline; a forced exit is SIGKILL.
 *  - Single ownership: `tryAcquireDbLock` auto-registers; the returned handle's
 *    `release()` deregisters. No double-register.
 *  - Best-effort: callbacks run via Promise.allSettled with a 3s deadline.
 *    Throws don't block other callbacks; a closed engine pool → the DELETE fails
 *    silently → the process exits anyway.
 *  - Normal exit path unchanged: the try/finally in the caller already releases
 *    on normal completion; deregister-before-release is atomic in
 *    single-threaded JS so there is no double-DELETE.
