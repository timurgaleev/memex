/**
 * Deletion-reconcile — the missing half of the mtime-incremental sweep.
 *
 * The sweep re-indexes new/changed files but is blind to DELETIONS: a file
 * removed from the vault leaves its `documents` row + chunks + embeddings
 * stranded in the DB, where they keep surfacing as (now false) evidence. Only
 * a full `--all` re-index used to clear them. This pass targets exactly that
 * gap: after a sweep has walked the on-disk files under a root, soft-delete the
 * DB documents beneath that same root whose `source_path` is no longer present
 * on disk.
 *
 * SAFETY — this only ever soft-deletes a document when BOTH hold:
 *   1. its `source_path` lives under `rootPrefix` (the exact root swept in this
 *      run), so a partial sweep can never retire a document owned by another
 *      source or another vault; and
 *   2. `existsSync(source_path)` is false — the file is genuinely gone, not
 *      merely unwalked (this mirrors orphans-purge's missing-on-disk probe).
 *
 * Deletion is the SAME soft-delete primitive the destructive-guard path uses
 * (`softDeleteDocuments` → `deleted_at = NOW()`), so chunks/embeddings/links are
 * retired and hard-purged identically after the shared 72h TTL. No new deletion
 * path is introduced here.
