/**
 * Shared transactional writer for documents + chunks + entity_mentions.

 * Used by both the markdown indexer (`core/indexer.ts`) and the code
 * indexer (`core/indexer-code.ts`). The two callers differ in two ways:
 *
 *   1. Markdown ships per-chunk Titan vectors → embeddings rows.
 *      Code is graph-only (Q1 = hashed-only) → no embeddings.
 *   2. Code chunks have line ranges (start_line, end_line) populated by
 *      tree-sitter; markdown chunks leave them NULL.
 *
 * The contract: caller pre-computes everything (chunks, entities, optional
 * vectors, optional line ranges); this function just writes it atomically.
 * Re-running with the same documentId wipes prior chunks (cascades to
 * embeddings + entity_mentions).
