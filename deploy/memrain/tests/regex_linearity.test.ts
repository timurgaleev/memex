 * Linearity guards for three scanners that were measured quadratic, each on a

 * quantifier accepts and a suffix that makes the match fail.

 * The ceilings are deliberately loose. Linear runs each of these in single-digit
 * milliseconds; the quadratic versions needed minutes at the same size. Nothing
 * a slow CI box does can manufacture a miss that wide.
