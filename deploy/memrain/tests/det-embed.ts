 * Deterministic basis-vector embedder for hermetic retrieval tests.
 *
 * Maps text → a fixed 1024-dim (the production Titan dimension, so it fits the
 * `vector(1024)` column) unit vector by hashing each token to a dimension and
 * accumulating term frequency, then L2-normalizing. Two texts that share terms
 * get a small cosine distance (pgvector `<=>`), so the vector arm ranks
 * shared-vocabulary docs near a query — WITHOUT any Bedrock call. Pure +
 * deterministic: identical input always yields the identical vector, so a
 * retrieval-quality gate built on it is reproducible in CI.
 *
 * This is a TEST utility (no production code depends on it). It is intentionally
 * a bag-of-words proxy, not a semantic model — enough to exercise the real
 * vector + keyword + RRF fusion path deterministically.

 * the keyword arm carry identical signal (token overlap), and a hermetic gate
 * could pass with a totally broken vector arm. Keep it small + obvious.
