 *   resolveTake — write the resolution tuple onto a synth_takes row. This is
 *     how a take gets RESOLVED (by the operator, or by the gated auto-resolve
 *     path in grade_takes) — distinct from synth_take_grades, which stay
 *     advisory judge verdicts. Calibration then measures the human: the
 *     scorecard reads the take's own resolution tuple ahead of the latest

 *   syncTakesFromFence — derive synth_takes rows from a page's fenced takes
 *     table. Markdown is canonical; the DB rows are the index. Keyed on
 *     (source_ref, row_num), append-only row numbers, so re-sync is
 *     idempotent and claim edits update in place.
