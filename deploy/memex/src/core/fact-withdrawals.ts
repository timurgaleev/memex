/**
 * Claim withdrawals (migration 112): a forgotten claim stays forgotten under
 * its (source_id, visibility, entity_slug, claim_key) key.
 *
 * Lock order, for every transaction that touches both: take fact row locks
 * first (UPDATE/DELETE of entity_facts), the per-source withdraw lock after.
 * Inserts take the lock shared from the migration 112 trigger, and a fence
 * reconcile deletes a page's rows before it inserts, so a writer that took the
 * exclusive lock and then waited on a fact row would deadlock against it.
 * Under the exclusive lock, only re-sweep for rows that raced in; every row
 * already committed is retired before the lock is taken.
 *
 * That two-sided sweep is why no single global order exists: the retirement has
 * to run once outside the lock and once under it. Two writers in this order (a
 * forget and a merge; a forget and a fence rebuild) can therefore still close a
 * cycle — the second sweep waits on a row the other side holds while the other
 * side waits for the lock — so every transaction that takes this lock goes
 * through `deadlockSafeTransaction` and is re-run if Postgres aborts it.
