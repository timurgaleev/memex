/**
 * chunker-version.ts — re-chunk staleness over `documents.chunker_version`
 * (migration 052).
 *
 * A document is STALE for re-chunking when its stamped chunker version is below
 * the CURRENT version of the chunker that produced it. The two chunkers carry
 * independent version namespaces (markdown vs code), so the staleness check
 * branches on document kind. memex treats markdown as the NEGATION of code
 * (`frontmatter->>'kind' <> 'code'`) because markdown frontmatter is user-shaped
 * and usually carries no `kind`. This holds for memex's two-kind (markdown +
 * code) corpus — if a third doc kind is ever indexed it would fall into the
 * markdown comparison; split the predicate then.
 *
 * DETECT-ONLY (same as the LINK_EXTRACTOR_VERSION watermark): this only COUNTS
 * stale docs — there is no post-upgrade re-embed sweep, so a bumped chunker
 * constant raises the doctor count but performs no work — a stale doc re-chunks
 * lazily on its next natural reindex. A batch re-chunk sweep is a follow-up
 * (TODO).
