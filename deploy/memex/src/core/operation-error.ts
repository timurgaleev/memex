/**
 * Structured, agent-consumable error envelope for MCP operations.
 *
 * Raw `Error().message` strings lose signal: the agent (the MCP client) can't
 * tell a retryable storage hiccup from a fatal bad-param, and gets no recovery
 * hint. `OperationError` carries a stable machine code, a human message, and
 * optional `suggestion` / `docs` so the caller can act.
 *
 * The PUBLIC-INGRESS redaction contract (`toEnvelope`): on the public boundary the
 * free-text `message` is withheld — it is the only field that could carry
 * runtime-interpolated detail — while the constrained `error` code and the
 * author-authored static `suggestion` / `docs` pass through. So a public
 * caller still learns the error CATEGORY and how to recover, but never a
 * free-text string that might embed internal detail. Internal ingress gets the
 * full envelope including `message`.
 *
 * INVARIANT (enforced by review): an `OperationError` is for KNOWN, validated
 * conditions (bad params, not-found, unsupported mode). Never wrap a raw caught
 * exception's `.message` into one — that would route un-redacted exception text
 * (Postgres detail, DSN host, stack internals) through the structured path. Raw
 * exceptions must stay on the `publicSafeErrorMessage` path, which fully
 * redacts them on public ingress.
