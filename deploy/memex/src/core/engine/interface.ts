/**
 * Engine interface — common surface for PGLite and Postgres adapters.
 *
 * Both engines speak the same Postgres SQL dialect (we only use what's
 * portable between them). The interface is intentionally narrow:
 *
 *   - query<T>: read or write returning rows; uses $1, $2 placeholders
 *   - exec:    fire-and-forget multi-statement DDL or transaction control
 *   - ready:   wait for the underlying client to finish init
 *   - close:   release the connection / pool
 *
 * Higher-level state (transactions, prepared statements, batches) is
 * orchestrated at the call site and works because both engines support
 * standard SQL `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `ROLLBACK`.
