/**
 * Recursive markdown chunker — heading + paragraph + size-bounded splitter.
 *
 * Strategy:
 *   1. Parse + strip YAML frontmatter (delegated to ../frontmatter.ts).
 *   2. Split the body by H1 / H2 boundaries — each becomes one section.
 *   3. If a section exceeds `maxChars`, sub-split by paragraph; pack
 *      paragraphs greedily into chunks <= maxChars.
 *   4. Merge any chunk shorter than `minChars` with its next sibling.
 *
 * Char-bounded (not token-bounded) on purpose: no tokenizer dependency,
 * Bedrock Titan is character-tolerant, and chunk sizing has loose tails
 * by design.
 *
 * This is the only chunker that actually runs today. `code.ts` and
 * `semantic.ts` are stubs for future content types.
