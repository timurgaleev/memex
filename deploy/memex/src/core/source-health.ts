/**
 * source-health.ts — brain-level operational health metrics.
 *
 * memex is single-holder / effectively single-source, so these are reported at
 * the brain level rather than per-source (a per-source breakdown collapses to
 * one row here). They answer "is the brain ingesting + embedding
 * its data, and is the job queue healthy?":
 *
 *   - embed_coverage_pct : of the chunks that SHOULD carry a vector (markdown /
 *     non-code — code chunks are graph-only by design, `kind:'code'` — and not
 *     under an `embed_skip` page, which the embed paths never touch), how many
 *     actually have an embeddings row. A low value means the vector arm of
 *     hybrid search can't see those chunks (keyword/FTS still can).
 *   - lag_seconds        : wall-clock staleness = now − newest document update.
 *   - queue_depth        : pending jobs waiting to run.
 *   - failed_jobs_24h    : jobs that FAILED in the last 24h — the one
 *     unambiguous "something broke" signal.
 *
 * Pure read-only aggregation. No Bedrock, no writes. Cheap enough for a doctor
 * probe.
