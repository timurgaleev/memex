/**
 * Timeline extraction from meetings -- deterministic, LLM-free. For each
 * meeting page with a resolvable date, write append-only timeline_events
 * (migration 017) for the meeting itself and for each resolved attendee, so a
 * person's timeline shows the meetings they attended.
 *
 * Faithful adaptation of the reference's extract-timeline-from-meetings. Two
 * divergences for this brain:
 *   - reads attendees from the meeting's `attendees` / `attended_by`
 *     compiled_truth fields DIRECTLY (self-contained -- does not depend on the
 *     opt-in typed-link `attended` edges being enabled);
 *   - the meeting date is resolved from HIGH-PRECISION sources only (no
 *     `effective_date` column): the explicit `compiled_truth.date` field, else
 *     a `YYYY-MM-DD` embedded in the slug. A free-text body date-mention is
 *     deliberately NOT used -- the first date in a meeting note is often a
 *     referenced/follow-up date, not the meeting's own, and a wrong date fans
 *     out to every attendee on an otherwise-immutable store.
 *
 * OPT-IN (`MEMEX_MEETING_TIMELINE=1`, default OFF). The phase is a
 * REPLACE-OWN-PROJECTION: each run first DELETES this meeting's own derived
 * events (those carrying `source_chunk_id='meeting-timeline:<slug>'`) and then
 * re-derives them from the CURRENT frontmatter -- so a corrected date or a
 * removed attendee is reflected, not left as a permanent stale row. It only
 * ever touches its own synthetic rows; user / recipe timeline events (a
 * different or NULL source_chunk_id) are never deleted. Default OFF because a
 * mis-resolved attendee is still a wrong (if self-correcting) entry, so the
 * operator confirms resolution on their vault first.
 *
 * Notes: attendee resolution goes through the slug canonicalizer, so with
 * `MEMEX_WIKILINK_CANONICALIZE=0` even exact-slug attendees stop resolving and
 * only the meeting-self event is written. The scan is bounded to the most
 * recently-updated `MAX_MEETINGS` meetings; on a vault larger than that, raise
 * the cap to re-project older meetings.
