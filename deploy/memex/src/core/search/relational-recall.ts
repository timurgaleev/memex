/**
 * Relational recall — a deterministic relational-query arm (LLM-free).
 *
 * Some questions are answered by an EDGE between entities, not by a passage:
 * "who founded acme", "where does alice work", "what connects bob and carol".
 * Lexical / vector search surfaces those poorly because the answer lives in the
 * typed-link graph, not in any single chunk. This module turns such a query
 * into edge-derived candidate slugs by:
 *
 *   1. parsing a relational intent + extracting the seed entity + relation
 *      (regex/keyword only — see {@link parseRelationalQuery}, NO LLM);
 *   2. resolving the seed phrase to a real page slug via the same 4-stage
 *      canonicalizer the wikilink scanner uses ({@link makeSlugResolver});
 *   3. fanning out the matched typed edges over the `links` table
 *      ({@link graphNeighbors} for depth 1, {@link traverseGraph} for the
 *      type-agnostic `connects` walk).
 *
 * Determinism + safety. Detection parses the ORIGINAL query (never an
 * LLM-expanded variant). Seed resolution is gated: a phrase that only
 * slugify-falls-back (no real page) is dropped, so the arm never traverses
 * from an invented slug. Fail-OPEN: any error returns an empty list — this is
 * a standalone, additive MCP read tool (`relational_recall`), wired OUTSIDE
 * the hybridSearch hot path, so a fault here can never break search.
 *
 * Scope (v1, deliberate). Single-source, single-seed for the typed archetypes;
 * `connects` resolves two seeds and intersects their reachable sets. memex has
 * no `introduced`/`knows`-style edge for "who introduced me to X", so that
 * archetype walks type-agnostically (any edge touching the seed is the signal).
 *
 * Tested in tests/relational_recall.test.ts.

/**
 * On the cost of the patterns below, and why they are left as they are.
 *
 * Every `\s+` next to a SEED can trade characters with it — `.` accepts a
 * space — so inside one call these do backtrack super-linearly. What they
 * cannot do is grow: the only caller, {@link parseRelationalQuery}, rejects a
 * query over 512 chars before any pattern runs, and SEED caps a capture at 80.
 *
 * Measured through parseRelationalQuery over 31 attack shapes, worst first:
 * `who at ` + a 505-char whitespace run = 29.3 ms; `how are a and ` + run =
 * 16.5 ms; `what connects ` + run = 8.6 ms; `where does ` + run = 7.0 ms. From
 * 64 to 512 chars that worst shape grows 9.5x, 6.3x, 5.0x per doubling. The
 * 29 ms is a ceiling and not a sample: the same input at 1 K, 4 K, 16 K and
 * 64 K chars returns null in 0.000 ms, because the length gate fires first.
 *
 * So the bound is already in place, one frame up, and a 512-char query is the
 * most expensive one that exists. Narrowing the whitespace classes to remove
 * the backtracking would change which phrasings parse into a seed, on an arm
 * whose whole job is deciding that — not a trade worth 29 ms. This is also a
 * standalone MCP read tool, wired off the hybridSearch hot path (see the
 * module header), so the cost is paid once per explicit `relational_recall`
 * call, not once per search.
