/**
 * Search meta — what a caller needs to tell "the brain has nothing" from "the

 * channel; the hits array itself never changes shape.
 *
 * The degraded vocabulary is closed on purpose. A non-operator caller gets
 * only the codes that describe the pipeline rather than the corpus: counts,
 * keyword_zero and budget_truncated are all computed before the dispatch-side
 * page and diary fences, so on an empty fenced result they would still tell
 * the caller that hidden content matched its query.
