/**
 * `chronicle_extract` job handler — segments one depth page into timeline
 * events OFF the hot write path. Registered at serve startup like the other
 * durable handlers; the worker dispatches by kind.
 *
 * The judge defaults to the paid Sonnet path inside extract-events (omitting
 * `judge` selects it), so this handler spends tokens only when the caller
 * enqueues it. It no-ops cleanly when the page has vanished — runChronicleExtract
 * returns a `skipped/page_not_found` result rather than throwing, so a benign
 * put-then-delete race succeeds instead of dead-lettering.
