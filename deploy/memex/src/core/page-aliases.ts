/**
 * Declared page aliases (migration 034).
 *
 * A page declares alternate names in `compiled_truth.aliases`; this module
 * normalizes them, keeps the `page_aliases` index in lockstep with each
 * page write, and resolves a free-text mention to a unique canonical slug.
 *
 * Aliases are FREE TEXT (a person's other name, a company's short name),
 * normalized as a phrase — lowercase / NFKC / whitespace-collapsed — NOT
 * slugified. The slug canonicalizer consults this as a high-confidence
 * stage (a declared alias is authoritative): ranked just below an exact
 * slug match and above the fuzzy tail/prefix/trigram cascade.
 *
 * EVENTUAL CONSISTENCY (by design, same model as the slug canonicalizer):
 * the alias index drives resolution at WIKILINK-WRITE time. Adding an alias
 * to `people/bob` does NOT retro-rewrite a `[[Robert]]` edge that some other
 * page already wrote to `robert`; that edge re-resolves on its own next
 * `syncWikilinksForPage` (i.e. when its source page is re-put). A migration
 * needs no backfill: declared aliases are a NEW convention introduced with
 * migration 034, so no pre-existing page carries one to index.
