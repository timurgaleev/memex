 * Slug redirects (migration 067).

 * page is RENAMED or MERGED (see `renamePage` in pages.ts). It lets a stale
 * `[[old-slug]]` wikilink and a direct `page_get old-slug` still land on the
 * live page instead of 404-ing or minting a dangling target.
 *
 * DISTINCT from `page_aliases` (migration 034): that table maps a normalized
 * free-text NAME → slug and feeds the wikilink canonicalizer's declared-alias
 * stage. This table maps an OLD SLUG → the canonical slug. See the migration
 * header for the full contrast.
 *
 * Source-scoped (migration 047 tenant axis): a redirect resolves ONLY against
 * the caller's own source(s), so a rename under one tenant never forwards
 * another tenant's slug. A single hop only — chains are collapsed at write time
 * by `renamePage`, not followed transitively here.
