/**
 * Entity-slug canonicalization — a deterministic, LLM-free resolver that
 * maps a loose `[[wikilink]]` mention to an EXISTING canonical page slug.
 *
 * Today the wikilink scanner (`syncWikilinksForPage`) slugifies a mention
 * and writes the edge to whatever slug falls out — so `[[Alice Smith]]`
 * mints a dangling `alice-smith` target even when the page actually lives
 * at `people/alice-smith`. This resolver closes that gap with a cascade
 * ordered by DESCENDING CONFIDENCE — structurally-exact matches first,
 * the fuzzy approximate match last and only when unambiguous:
 *
 *   1. exact       — the slugified mention IS an existing page slug.
 *   2. alias       — exactly one live page DECLARES the mention as an alias
 *                    (`compiled_truth.aliases`, migration 034). Authoritative
 *                    (`[[Robert]]` → `people/bob`); a collision falls through.
 *   3. exact-tail  — exactly one live page whose slug basename equals the
 *                    slugified mention (`[[Acme]]` → `companies/acme`).
 *   4. prefix      — exactly one live page whose basename STARTS WITH the
 *                    mention (`[[alice]]` → `people/alice-smith`).
 *   5. trgm fuzzy  — pg_trgm `similarity()` on title + slug basename, above
 *                    a threshold AND clear of the runner-up by a margin
 *                    (catches typos / title↔slug drift).
 *   6. slugify     — fall back to the legacy slugified target. Always
 *                    returns a slug so an edge is still created; the caller
 *                    stamps it `unqualified`.
 *
 * SAFE-BY-DEFAULT (security-engineer / ai-engineer review). A source-scoped
 * resolver would earn its safety from source-scoping + dir/page-type hints,
 * which memex's single flat vault does not have. To compensate for the
 * lost scoping this resolver:
 *   - runs the fuzzy stage LAST (a structurally-exact tail/prefix never
 *     loses to an approximate title match);
 *   - resolves tail/prefix ONLY when the match is UNIQUE — genuine
 *     ambiguity (two `acme` basenames, two `alice-...` prefixes) falls to the
 *     slugify floor rather than being silently arbitrated;
 *   - gates the fuzzy stage on both a conservative threshold (default
 *     0.7) AND a margin over the runner-up, so near-ties don't coin-flip;
 *   - deliberately does NOT use connection_count to break ties: it is a
 *     rich-get-richer bias (a new page always loses to an established
 *     same-prefix page) and arbitrating real ambiguity is the worst
 *     failure mode for graph integrity. A wrong `qualified` edge would
 *     also feed future resolutions, compounding the error.
 *
 * No GIN trigram index: stage 4 filters on an explicit `similarity() >= t`
 * threshold (not the `%` operator), so the function alone suffices at this
 * vault's scale. See migration 033 for the scale note.
