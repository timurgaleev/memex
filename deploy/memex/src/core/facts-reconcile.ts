/**
 * Facts-fence reconciliation — make the entity_facts DB index match a page's
 * `## Facts` fence (the system of record). LLM-FREE: the fence is canonical
 * structured markdown; this deterministically parses it and re-projects it
 * into the DB. (The extract_facts cycle phase, minus optional fact-text
 * embedding — memex can add that later via its existing Bedrock path; the
 * reconcile itself never needs a model.)
 *
 * Per page write, `reconcileFactsForPage`:
 *   1. RE-READS the page's CURRENT body + content_hash, and skips if the page
 *      moved on since the triggering write (a newer write's own reconcile will
 *      project the newer body) — this is the concurrency guard,
 *   2. parses the `## Facts` fence (core/facts-fence.ts),
 *   3. WIPES that page's fence-owned fact rows
 *      (`DELETE … WHERE source_markdown_slug = <page>`),
 *   4. re-inserts the ACTIVE (non-struck) fence rows, keyed by
 *      `source_markdown_slug` + `row_num` (migration 035).
 *
 * It runs on EVERY page write (not just content changes) so an idempotent
 * re-put is a REPAIR path: if a prior reconcile failed, re-putting the page
 * rebuilds the index. The wipe is scoped to `source_markdown_slug = <page>`,
 * so a legacy or explicitly-asserted fact (NULL source_markdown_slug, e.g. via
 * `add_fact`) is INVISIBLE to it and survives — the column scoping is the
 * empty-fence guard.
 *
 * A page whose fence is genuinely ABSENT (no fence markers) wipes its own
 * fence rows (operator removed the fence). But a fence whose markers are
 * PRESENT yet parse to zero rows (a hand-edit syntax typo, or an emptied
 * table) does NOT wipe — a malformed fence must never silently destroy the
 * prior projection. The same holds for a PARTIALLY malformed fence (some rows
 * parse, some are claimless/broken): wiping would delete the broken rows'
 * prior projections, so the reconcile is refused until the fence is fixed.
 *
 * Each fence fact is keyed `entity_slug = <the page hosting the fence>` — the
 * fence states facts ABOUT that page's subject. `entity_slug` has no FK, so a
 * fence on a non-entity page is harmless. A page's markdown body is NOT
 * chunk-indexed (pages are the DB-canonical store; the search chunk index
 * comes from `indexDocument`, which strips the fence first), so the fence is
 * never double-represented as searchable prose.
