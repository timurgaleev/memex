/**
 * Storage lifecycle for command handlers.
 *
 * Every `memex <cmd>` opens a Storage, does its work, and closes it. The shape
 * lives here once rather than in forty handlers, because two details of it are
 * easy to get wrong and were:
 *
 *   - `init()` runs INSIDE the try. Written as `init(); try { … } finally {
 *     close() }` a failed migration or a refused connect skips the finally
 *     entirely and strands the engine — a PGLite WASM heap or a Postgres pool
 *     for the life of the process, plus the data-directory lock, which then
 *     refuses the next open in the same process.
 *   - a `close()` that fails while the body is already failing does not
 *     replace the body's error. PGLite's `close()` throws a bare `Aborted()`
 *     when the directory never opened, and that is exactly the run where
 *     `init()`'s diagnosis ("pglite: cannot open <path> …") is the only thing
 *     that tells an operator what actually broke.
