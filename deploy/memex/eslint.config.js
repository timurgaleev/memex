// The compiler already gates types (`bun run typecheck`). This layer catches
// what types cannot: a value bound and never used, a variable shadowing an
// outer one, a promise nobody awaited, an `any` that erases a boundary. Those
// are the shapes behind the fixture bugs this repo keeps hitting.
//
// Formatting is deliberately OFF. This codebase has 74k lines of existing
// layout and a reformat would bury every future diff in noise; the value here
// is the correctness rules, not the whitespace.
