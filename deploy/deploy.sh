#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Deploy the memrain container from the checkout in /opt/<project>, stamped
# with the version it was built from, and start the ingress only after the new
# container proved it serves the real brain.
#
# Order: preflights (compose parses, no pre-rename container, the secrets are
# staged under the new name, the Postgres URL is staged when required) → build
# the image → stop the ingress → start the app alone → healthy + stamp gate →
# data gates (db=postgres, pages ≥ the floor, OAuth state consistent) →
# ingress. A failed build changes nothing that runs. A
# failed gate leaves the ingress stopped and the app unreachable from outside.
# With MEMRAIN_MAINTENANCE=1 the ingress is held back.
#
# Why the stamp exists: the build arg, the Dockerfile ENV, `version.ts` and the
# `/health` payload were wired end to end, but nothing ever supplied the value,
# so every image ever built was stamped `dev`. A deploy could not be told apart
# from a no-op.
#
# Run from the repo root on the instance, after `git pull --ff-only`.
#
# Knobs (shell env):
#   DEPLOY_MIN_PAGES   page floor when no container is running to read one
#                      from (a non-negative integer). The larger of the two
#                      wins when both are known.
#   DEPLOY_ALLOW_PGLITE=1   accept db=pglite (a dev or PGLite install). The
#                      page and OAuth gates cannot run there and are skipped.
#   DEPLOY_ALLOW_EMPTY=1    accept an empty brain (a fresh install).
#   DEPLOY_ALLOW_INGRESS_IN_MAINTENANCE=1   start the ingress even in
#                      maintenance (a rehearsal only).
