## Safety gate (REQUIRED, no exceptions)

archive-crawler refuses to run unless a `scan_paths:` allow-list is
explicitly set in the brain page `config/archive-crawler` (read it with
`page_get config/archive-crawler`). This is a deliberate safety fence
against the agent over-scoping a scan and ingesting sensitive content
(tax PDFs, medical records, credentials).

```yaml
# config/archive-crawler — frontmatter; the allow-list is mandatory
scan_paths:
  - ~/Documents/writing/
  - ~/Dropbox/Archive/
  - /mnt/backup/old-letters/
# Optional deny-list inside the allow-list:
# deny_paths:
#   - ~/Documents/finances/
#   - ~/Documents/medical/
```

If `scan_paths` is empty or the page is missing, the skill exits with:

```
archive-crawler: refusing to run. No `scan_paths:` allow-list on the
config/archive-crawler brain page. Add explicit paths the agent is
permitted to scan (page_put config/archive-crawler), then re-run.
This is a safety fence — the agent will not infer what's safe to read.
```

This contract is enforced by the agent itself: the allow-list check is
the first step of every run, before any filesystem access.

## What this is

Generic engine for exploring any tree of personal content within an
explicit allow-list. Works on local mounts, Dropbox API targets,
Backblaze B2, Gmail takeouts (`.mbox`), and similar archives. Filters
for "gold" (the user's own writing, ideas, relationships) and surfaces
it interactively for review. Skips noise (system files, configs, binary
blobs).

## Concepts

### Source

A source is any tree of files to explore. Sources have:

- **type**: `local` | `dropbox` | `backblaze` | `gmail-takeout` | `mbox` | `pst`
- **root**: filesystem path, Dropbox path, B2 prefix, mbox path
- **manifest**: a brain page tracking progress at
  `projects/<archive-slug>/status`

### Manifest

Every archive exploration gets a manifest brain page that tracks:

1. **Tree inventory** — folders / files / sizes / types
2. **Triage status** — each item: `⬜ unseen` / `👀 reviewed` /
   `✅ ingested` / `⏭️ skip` / `🔥 high-signal`
3. **User reactions** — exact quotes when they react (per
   conventions/quality.md exact-phrasing rule)
4. **Priority queue** — what to explore next, ranked
5. **Session log** — timestamped record of what was shown per session

### Gold filter

Before showing anything to the user, apply the gold filter:

| Keep (show) | Skip (note existence, don't show) |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Personal writing (journals, letters, reflections, essays) | System files, configs, package.json, node_modules |
| Conversations (IM logs, email threads with substance) | Binary blobs (images / video) |
| Ideas, theses, frameworks | Receipts, invoices, tax docs |
| Relationship material (letters to / from people who matter) | Spam, newsletters, mailing-list bulk |
| Creative work (poetry, stories, code with soul) | Corrupted / null files |
| Origin stories (first versions of things that became important) | |
| Emotional content (anger, love, grief, discovery) | |

## Protocol

### Phase 1: Inventory

When pointed at a new source:

1. **Confirm scan_paths is set** (safety gate: `page_get config/archive-crawler`). Exit if not.
2. **Map the tree** — list folders + files + sizes + date ranges.
3. **Classify folders** — group by likely content type (writing, email,
   code, photos, docs, system).
4. **Create manifest** — `page_put projects/<archive-slug>/status` with
   the full inventory.
5. **Propose priority queue** — rank folders by likely gold density.
6. **Present to user** — show the map and proposed order. Let them
   override.

### Phase 2: Crawl

Work through folders in priority order:

1. **Read before showing** — open each candidate file, apply the gold
   filter, skip noise.
2. **Show one at a time** — present gold items individually for review.
3. **Capture exact reaction** — track the user's response in the
   manifest using their exact words (per conventions/quality.md).
4. **Ingest if worth keeping** — create a brain page immediately via
   `page_put`.
5. **Update manifest** — mark item status after each interaction
   (`page_put` or `page_append` the status page).
6. **Never re-show** — check the manifest before presenting anything.

### Phase 3: Ingest

When an item is worth keeping, file it by **primary subject** per
`_brain-filing-rules.md`:

- User's own writing / ideas / origin-story content → `originals/<slug>`
- Reflections / personal-life content → `personal/<slug>`
- Product / business ideas → `ideas/<slug>`
- Letters or threads about a specific person → `people/<person>` timeline
  back-link (via `add_timeline_event` + `link`) plus the letter at
  `personal/<slug>` or `originals/<slug>`

**The skill is schema-generic.** It does NOT bake in any specific
era-folder structure (e.g., `originals/archive/` for pre-2003 content,
`originals/startup-era/` for later material, etc.). The user's filing
rules from `_brain-filing-rules.json` are read at runtime; the agent
decides per-page where content lands within those sanctioned directories.

Brain page format:

```markdown
---
title: "[Title or first line]"
type: original
source_type: "[local|dropbox|backblaze|gmail-takeout|mbox|pst]"
source_path: "[path within the allow-listed scan_paths]"
date: "YYYY-MM-DD"  # date from the file metadata or content
people: ["person-1", "person-2"]
tags: ["tag-1", "tag-2"]
---

# [Title]

[Summary: what it is, when it's from, why it matters]

**User's reaction:** [exact quote, no paraphrasing]

## Context

[Cross-links to people, concepts, projects.]

## File-type handlers

### Plain text / HTML / Markdown
Read directly. Strip HTML tags for display.

### `.mbox` (email archives)

```python
import mailbox
mbox = mailbox.mbox('/path/to/file.mbox')
for msg in mbox:
    body = ''
    if msg.is_multipart():
        for part in msg.walk():
            if part.get_content_type() == 'text/plain':
                body = part.get_payload(decode=True).decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
                break
    else:
        body = msg.get_payload(decode=True).decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
    # Apply gold filter
```

### `.doc` / `.docx`

```bash
# .docx (modern)
python3 -c "
import zipfile, xml.etree.ElementTree as ET
with zipfile.ZipFile('/path/to/file.docx') as z:
    tree = ET.parse(z.open('word/document.xml'))
    print(''.join(t.text or '' for t in tree.iter('{http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main}t')))
"

# .doc (legacy, requires antiword or catdoc)
antiword /path/to/file.doc 2>/dev/null || catdoc /path/to/file.doc 2>/dev/null
```

### `.pst` (Outlook archives)

```bash
# Validate first; many PSTs are null bytes
python3 -c "
with open('/path/to/file.pst', 'rb') as f:
    print('Valid PST' if f.read(4) == b'!BDN' else 'CORRUPT/NULL')
"
# If valid:
readpst -o /tmp/pst-output /path/to/file.pst
```

### `.zip` / `.tar` / `.tar.gz`

Extract to a temp dir, then recurse through the extracted tree.

### Images

Note existence + metadata (filename, size, date). Don't show unless the
user asks. Flag scans / portraits as potentially personal.

## Manifest template

```markdown
---
title: "[Archive Name] — Ingestion Status"
type: project
created: YYYY-MM-DD
updated: YYYY-MM-DD
source_type: "[local|dropbox|...]"
scan_paths: ["paths from config/archive-crawler"]

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Running without `scan_paths:` set on `config/archive-crawler`.
  Hard refusal. This is the safety contract — never bypass.
- ❌ Hardcoding era-specific filing paths (e.g., `originals/archive/`,
  `originals/startup-era/`). Read filing rules at runtime instead.
- ❌ Re-showing items already marked in the manifest. The user's time
  is the scarcest resource.
- ❌ Paraphrasing reactions. Exact words only.
- ❌ Wrapping found content in lessons or takeaways. Let stories breathe.
- ❌ Skipping back-links when content references people / companies who
  have brain pages. Iron Law per conventions/quality.md.

- Routing matches the canonical triggers in the frontmatter.
- Output written under the directories listed in `writes_to:` (when applicable).
- Conventions referenced (`quality.md`, `brain-first.md`, `_brain-filing-rules.md`) are followed.
- Privacy contract preserved: no real names, no host-specific filesystem path literals.

The full behavior contract is documented in the body sections above; this section exists for the conformance test.

## Output Format

The skill's output shape is documented inline in the body sections above (see "Output", "Brain page format", or equivalent). The literal section header here exists for the conformance test.
