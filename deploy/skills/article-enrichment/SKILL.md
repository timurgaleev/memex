# article-enrichment — From Raw Dumps to Useful Brain Pages

> **Convention:** see conventions/quality.md (via `get_skill conventions/quality`)
> for citation rules, verbatim-quote requirements, and back-link enforcement.
>
> **Convention:** see `_brain-filing-rules.md` (via `get_skill _brain-filing-rules`)

> personalized one-of-one synthesis output uses the sanctioned
> `media/articles/<slug>-personalized` exception.

## What this does

Takes an article brain page that's a wall of raw extracted text and rewrites
it as a structured page with:

- **Executive Summary** — 2-3 sentences, the ONE thing worth remembering
- **Why It Matters** — connects to the user's specific projects + interests
  (read from brain context, not assumed)
- **Quotable Lines** — 3-5 VERBATIM quotes worth referencing in essays
- **Key Insights** — actual insights, not topic labels
- **Surprising or Counterintuitive** — what makes this content unique
- **See Also** — standard markdown links to related brain pages

Raw source content is preserved in a collapsed `<details>` section so the
original is never lost.

## When to invoke

- New article page lands in the brain via media-ingest with `needs_enrichment: true`
- Existing article page is a wall of text under a `## Content` header with
  no synthesis
- User says a brain page is useless, boring, or a dump
- An LLM-judge brain-quality eval fails on quotability or actionability for
  an article page

## The pipeline

```
1. READ      → page_get the article brain page; parse frontmatter + body.
2. SCAN      → Look for ## Content (raw dump) and absence of ## Executive Summary.
3. CONTEXT   → query the article's key entities to ground "Why It Matters".
4. ENRICH    → The agent restructures (synthesis-tier quality for
               high-value content; see Model selection).
5. WRITE     → Replace ## Content with the structured sections; preserve raw
               source in <details>; clear needs_enrichment in frontmatter.
6. CROSS-LINK→ Add back-links from referenced people/companies pages
               (Iron Law per conventions/quality.md).
```

## Invocation

The skill itself is markdown instructions to the agent. It does NOT ship a
deterministic CLI command. The agent uses memex's existing operations:

```bash
# 1. Find candidate pages
memex call search '{"query":"needs_enrichment: true type:article","limit":50}'

# 2. For each candidate, read the page
memex call page_get '{"slug":"media/articles/<slug>"}'

# 3. Enrich via the agent's own reasoning (synthesis-tier care for
#    high-value pieces). The agent reads the raw content + brain context
#    and writes the structured page.

# 4. Write the enriched page
#    page_put with the new structured markdown body.

# 5. Cross-link entities
#    For every person/company mentioned, add a timeline back-link
#    (add_timeline_event + link).
```

(From an MCP client, call the tools directly — `search`, `page_get`,
`page_put`; the `memex call` form is for shell work.)

## Quality bar

An enriched page passes if it has:

- ✅ `## Executive Summary` (2-3 sentences)
- ✅ `## Quotable Lines` with ≥3 verbatim quotes (literal quotes, not paraphrase)
- ✅ `## Key Insights` with ≥3 bullets (insights, not topic labels)
- ✅ `## Why It Matters` connecting to specific brain context (not generic)
- ✅ `## See Also` with standard markdown links (NOT `[[wiki-links]]`)
- ✅ `<details>` block preserving the raw source content

## Model selection

| Tier | Use when | Quote accuracy |
|------|----------|----------------|
| **Utility tier (Haiku)** | Bulk enrichment drafts, most articles | Good — occasionally paraphrases |
| **Synthesis tier (Sonnet)** | High-value content, original-thinking pieces, longreads | Excellent — respects "verbatim" instruction |

Rule: for bulk enrichment, do a utility-tier draft pass and spot-check 5
with the LLM-judge brain-quality eval (`memex eval`). If quotes are
paraphrased, switch to the synthesis tier for that batch. When the agent
itself is doing the restructuring, apply the same bar: verbatim quotes
are non-negotiable.

## Link convention

All cross-references use standard markdown links: `[Title](relative/path.md)`.
NEVER use `[[wiki-links]]` — they don't render outside the brain.

## Anti-Patterns

- ❌ Paraphrasing quotes ("the author argues that…"). Quotes are verbatim
  or they're not quotes.
- ❌ Generic "Why It Matters" ("this is important because innovation").
  Tie to specific brain context or remove the section.
- ❌ Inventing topic labels and calling them insights. An insight is a
  thing the article says that you didn't already know.
- ❌ Discarding the raw source. Always wrap it in `<details>`.
- ❌ Re-enriching non-idempotently — check the `needs_enrichment` flag in
  frontmatter; skip if already false.

## Contract

This skill guarantees:

- Routing matches the canonical triggers in the frontmatter.
- Output written under the directories listed in `writes_to:` (when applicable).
- Conventions referenced (`quality.md`, `brain-first.md`, `_brain-filing-rules.md`) are followed.
- Privacy contract preserved: no real names, no host-specific filesystem path literals.

The full behavior contract is documented in the body sections above; this section exists for the conformance test.

## Output Format

The skill's output shape is documented inline in the body sections above (see "Output", "Brain page format", or equivalent). The literal section header here exists for the conformance test.
