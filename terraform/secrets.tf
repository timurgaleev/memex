# All secrets are created as empty placeholders.
# Fill them in AWS Console or CLI after deployment — never in Terraform state.
# Naming pattern: ${var.secrets_prefix}/<name>. Override secrets_prefix in
# terraform.tfvars to namespace per-environment (e.g. "stack-staging").
#
# recovery_window_in_days = 0 deletes a secret at once, so every secret is
# prevent_destroy: a rename that would replace one fails at plan instead.

# Only the Cloudflare Tunnel ingress needs a tunnel token. An
# ingress_mode="caddy" install has no tunnel, and a placeholder secret that
# nothing reads is an invitation to delete it by hand — which is exactly what
# happened on one install, leaving live and state disagreeing.
#
# Upgrade note: the `moved` block below re-addresses the existing (un-counted)
# resource so a cloudflare install plans a no-op state move, not a
# destroy+create of a live token. The secret is prevent_destroy, so a caddy
# install that still holds the placeholder in state (or any install switching
# ingress_mode away from cloudflare) fails at plan instead of deleting it.
# To retire it, drop it from state first — the secret itself stays in AWS:
#   terraform state rm 'aws_secretsmanager_secret.cloudflared_tunnel_token[0]'
# then delete it by hand only if nothing reads it. The same applies to the
# deploy-key secret below when use_ssh_deploy_key goes back to false.
