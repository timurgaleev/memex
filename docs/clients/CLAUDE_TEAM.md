# Connect a Claude Team or Enterprise organisation

On a Team or Enterprise plan only an Owner adds a custom connector, once, for
the whole organisation, and every member then connects to that same client. To
keep each member in their own space, register the client in **enrollment
mode**: each person redeems a one-time code on first connect, and that sign-in
is pinned to their source. The background and the security argument are in
[TEAM-SETUP.md](../TEAM-SETUP.md); this page is the checklist.

`memex …` below is the CLI on the host:
`docker exec deploy-memex-1 bun run src/cli.ts …` in an SSM session. Every
enrollment action except `invalidate-tokens` is also on the admin panel:
**Credentials → Members** on the connector's row, and **Revoke** on the row itself.

## Prerequisites

- memex is deployed, `curl -s <issuer>/health` returns `{"ok":true,...}`, and
  `MEMEX_PUBLIC_URL` is `<issuer>` (for example `https://brain.<domain>`).
- `MEMEX_TENANT_FAIL_CLOSED=1` on the host, so an authenticated caller with no
  grant reads nothing rather than the redacted whole brain.
- Dynamic Client Registration left off (`MEMEX_ENABLE_DCR` unset).

## Steps

1. A source per person:

   ```bash
   memex sources register alice --kind other --path-prefix tenant:alice
   memex sources register bob   --kind other --path-prefix tenant:bob
   ```

2. One connector, in enrollment mode:

   ```bash
   memex auth register-client team-claude \
     --tenant-mode enrollment --scopes 'read write' --source default \
     --redirect-uris 'https://claude.ai/api/mcp/auth_callback,https://claude.com/api/mcp/auth_callback'
   ```

   It prints `client_id` and `client_secret` once. `--source default` is only the
   fallback for a grant that names none; an enrolled session always overrides
   it. Confirm the client has no `client_credentials` grant — that is what makes
   sharing its secret with the Owner safe:

   ```bash
   memex auth list-clients
   # grant_types: ["authorization_code","refresh_token"]
   ```

3. A code per person, printed once each:

   ```bash
   memex auth enroll alice --label alice --client <client_id> --ttl 30d
   memex auth enroll bob   --label bob   --client <client_id> --ttl 30d
   ```

4. Budgets, per person (optional):

   ```bash
   memex auth set-budget <enrollment_id> 2.00     # one person
   memex auth set-budget <client_id> 2.00         # default for everyone else, applied per person
   ```

5. The Owner adds the connector (click-path checked against Anthropic's help
   center on 2026-09-28):

   - **Organization settings → Connectors**, click **Add**, hover **Custom**,
     choose **Web**.
   - URL `<issuer>/mcp`; under **Advanced settings**, **OAuth Client ID** and
     **OAuth Client Secret** from step 2.

6. Each member, in their own account: find the connector, click **Connect**,
   paste their code into memex's form, and they are returned to Claude. The
   refresh token carries the binding, so they never see the form again unless
   the chain breaks.

Send each code person to person, never into a shared channel. A code is a
bearer credential until it is used.

## Day-2

| Task | Command | Admin panel |
|---|---|---|
| List codes and grants | `memex auth enrollments --client <client_id>` | the Members view |
| Issue a code | `memex auth enroll <source> --client <client_id>` | **Issue code** in Members |
| Kill a code nobody has used | `memex auth revoke-enrollment <enrollment_id>` | **Revoke code** in Members |
| Cut off one person after they connected | `memex auth revoke-grant <enrollment_id>` — deletes that grant's tokens; everyone else keeps working | **Revoke grant** in Members |
| New code for the same person (lost device, broken refresh chain) | `memex auth enroll --replaces <enrollment_id>` — keeps source, read set, label, spend key and cap; the old grant works until the new code is redeemed | **New code** in Members, shown once the code is redeemed |
| Sign everyone out, keep the connector | `memex auth invalidate-tokens <client_id>` | CLI only |
| Sign one person out, keep their grant | `memex auth invalidate-tokens <client_id> --grant <enrollment_id>` | CLI only |
| Retire the connector | `memex auth revoke-client <client_id>` | **Revoke** on the Credentials row |

## Verify

Each member asks Claude to call memex's `whoami` tool: `write_source` must be
their own source. `memex auth enrollments --client <client_id>` shows each
grant as redeemed, with the time a token was last minted.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | First check |
|---|---|
| Member sees the admin login instead of a code field | The client is in `client` mode and `MEMEX_OAUTH_REQUIRE_LOGIN=1`. `memex auth rescope-client <client_id> --source default --tenant-mode enrollment`. |
| "That code was not accepted." | Used, expired, revoked or issued for another client — deliberately indistinguishable. `memex auth enrollments --client <client_id>` shows which. |
| `redirect_uri is not registered for this client` | The organisation uses a callback origin you did not register. `memex auth set-redirect-uris <client_id> <uri> <uri>`; the secret stays. |
| `invalid_target` | The connector URL is not `<issuer>/mcp` on the host `MEMEX_PUBLIC_URL` names. |
| A member lands in someone else's space | Codes were swapped at handover. `revoke-grant` both, issue new codes, hand over again. |
| `401` with `Bearer error="invalid_token"` for one member | Their grant was revoked or their refresh chain broke. Issue `enroll --replaces <enrollment_id>` and have them reconnect. |
| `budget_exhausted` | That person's daily cap is spent: `memex auth set-budget <enrollment_id> <usd>`. |
| Writes succeed but search does not find them | The budget ran out mid-index; the page is stored unembedded. Raise the cap, then `memex embed`. |
